In the following some brief descriptions of the classes involved in the project. \hypertarget{index_section1}{}\doxysection{Description}\label{index_section1}
A templated binary search tree implemented in C++ (compliant with the C++14 standard). The project is split into three files, each one of them contains the implementation of concept, and hence in each one of them we have a class declaration and definition.\hypertarget{index_subsection1}{}\doxysubsection{Node.\+h}\label{index_subsection1}
The implementation of the concept of a \mbox{\hyperlink{structNode}{Node}}. A \mbox{\hyperlink{structNode}{Node}} is templated on the type of the value, which in this project will be a {\ttfamily std\+::pair} with a key and a value, and must know its children and its parent. Therefore we have 4 data member. The pointers to the left and right child are {\ttfamily unique\+\_\+ptr}, while the pointer to the parent is a raw pointer. If it were a {\ttfamily unique\+\_\+ptr}, then we would end up with nodes that are pointed (uniquely) by more pointers, which is not correct.\hypertarget{index_subsection2}{}\doxysubsection{Iterator.\+h}\label{index_subsection2}
The class iterator is templated on the type \textquotesingle{}T\textquotesingle{} of the \mbox{\hyperlink{structNode}{Node}}, and on a boolean \textquotesingle{}is\+\_\+const\textquotesingle{}, used to determine the const-\/ness of the iterator by exploiting {\ttfamily std\+::conditional}, a C++11 which determines at compile time the types of a member. The most important operator is the \textquotesingle{}++\textquotesingle{} (pre-\/increment), which allows to go the next (ordering by key) \mbox{\hyperlink{structNode}{Node}} by returning a self-\/reference.\hypertarget{index_subsection3}{}\doxysubsection{bst.\+h}\label{index_subsection3}
This class contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree. It\textquotesingle{}s templated on the type of the key, on the type of the value, and on the type of the comparison operator, which is set to {\ttfamily std\+::less} by default. The data members are a {\ttfamily std\+::unique\+\_\+ptr} to the head \mbox{\hyperlink{structNode}{Node}}, and the comparison operator.
